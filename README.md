##### *Nonsense verse for no good reason whatsoever*

I did learn git before some time <br>
but hath I paid attention <br>
It wouldn't be me, addressing thee <br>
for no good of a reason.<br>

So one fine day, in bloomin' May<br>
When 'twas the github season<br>
I got myself a free account<br>
for no good of a reason.<br>

Then started I, pursuing my<br>
this love for github new<br>
And quite a while I did this too<br>
not knowing how time flew.<br>

But then it was, one fatal day<br>
I lost my newfound love<br>
For password mine, oh, did affine<br>
When it was all behove<br>
It fled to what alcove!<br>

You're reading this, but I shall hiss<br>
"What use is this thereof?"<br>
You're not one wise, *surprise surprise*<br>
This poem I'm tired of!<br>
